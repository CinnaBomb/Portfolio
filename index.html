      <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-8 col-md-inset-2 bio">

       <p>I am a web developer based in the Los Angeles area. I specialize in building websites from scratch with HTML and CSS/SASS and adding interactivity with Javascript and jQuery. I'm also well-versed in responsive design and know how to use Bootstrap as well as create my own grids. </p>

       <p>I work on a Windows machine with a Linux double boot and use Sublime 3 as my text editor. I use Gulp.js to speed up my workflow, Git and Github to back up my projects from the command line, and have experience using APIs. I've also designed websites and created high-quality clipart using Photoshop when my projects call for it.</p>

       <p>I have a keen interest in back-end development and programming apps. My in-progress education includes studying Ruby on Rails, React, Node, Express, PHP and SQL using various online resources including The Odin Project, Free Code Camp, Lynda.com, and W3Schools. </p>

       <p>I'm a problem solver, and am easily caught up in my work. I enjoy working with others, getting to learn their coding tricks and quirks, and teaching them mine. I like to create clean code that is easy for others to understand and contribute to. As a perfectionist, I often return to my work to clean up and improve on old code as I learn better practices.</p>
